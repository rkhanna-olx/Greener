## Installation

* MVVMRB 

MVVMRB is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/MVVMRB). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```rub
pod 'MVVMRB'
```

* MVVMRB Xcode Template

We have created Xcode templates to generate MVVMRB classes, ready to add business logic to them. Run the [install_template.sh](https://github.com/olxgroup-oss/MVVMRB/blob/master/template/install_template.sh) shell script to copy the templates to the Xcode templates folder. Once you have successfully copied the templates, when adding a new file in Xcode, the MVVMRB group will show up.
